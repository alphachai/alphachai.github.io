This is my [personal website](http://charliemathews.com).

I built it from scratch using vanilla HTML+SASS+JS (yarn/webpack), Jekyll, Markdown and [build-harness](https://github.com/mintel/build-harness). Deployed via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you're interested in learning more, I've written a [blog post](http://charliemathews.com/2020/05/17/github-pages.html) about this project.
